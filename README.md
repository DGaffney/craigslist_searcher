craigslist_searcher
===================

A little app to make searching craigslist for content less awful

IDEA:
===================

Searching craigslist is time consuming, annoying, and overlapping when you're looking for a specific apartment, house, or car for days/weeks on end. I want to build something that accomplishes the following general tasks in order to streamline the process of looking for things on craigslist:

1. Allow me to enter a super search (cars of this make/model between these years, perhaps a set of miles) that is tracked constantly
2. Send me updates when new things match
3. Disambiguate reposts of things.

Lots of semantic analysis work needs to be done on something like this, and potentially really useful for communities. Potentially huge wins: "show me apartments within 5 miles of this point that come up that match these parameters" is a really big point craigslist is not exploiting right now.
